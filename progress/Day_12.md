# Day 11 Journal â€” Job Board Project

**Date:** 06-10-2025  
**Time spent:** 120 minutes

## What I did today

The project had to be put on hold. Some problem with my bank account linking with AWS for the free tier. I have sort things out with my bank to allow transactions and stuff. Its complicated. Ill get back to the project as soon as everything is sorted.

Ill be doing other projects and I have to work on my basics as I was using ChatGPT and Claude a lot. Sometimes I would not even understand what I was doing. Some beginner level projects are coming up. Ill be starting a new repo to work on some AI projects and some very basic projects.

Im also working on building my DSA and system design (HLD and LLD) skills. Being able to solve those questions as they are really important for tech interview. My leetcode is looking solid, I have been giving contests every week. Im been exploring resources for sys des.

See you in a minute :)
